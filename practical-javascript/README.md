# Practical Javascript

Based on the "Practical Javascript" course, made by Gordon Zhu.

You can enroll in this course for free at https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript

Basically I will build a simple todo to practice the Javascript fundamentals (and maybe style it using Materialize CSS, who knows? :)
